Professor Katz said he doesn't want students to memorize things, but any exam question can come from a random slide or a footnote in the book. I recommend creating flash cards and sharing them.

I'm also a terrible programmer and did poorly on the extremely easy questions, but on Exam 4 I memorized some code steps so I could handle that part. I wish I had done the same for exam 3.
